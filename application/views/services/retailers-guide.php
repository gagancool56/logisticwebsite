                </div>
                <p>Developing a comprehensive logistics strategy ahead of time to prepare for peak seasons can go a long way toward navigating the turmoil and reducing service risk. Retailers may take use of best-in-class logistics techniques and innovative technologies to synchronize supplier compliance, order fulfilment, and other processes, resulting in increased efficiencies and resilience to shifting consumer demands. MTS partners provide not only technical solutions, but also domain specialists that cooperate with you to start planning well ahead of peak seasons. They should also oversee networks that optimize incoming and outbound transportation, ensuring that products are delivered on time and on budget to the proper location.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Increase network visibility and predictability in real time:</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Greater visibility and predictability are required in today's dynamic retail supply chains. Leading-edge transportation management systems (TMS) can process millions of data points in seconds using AI and machine learning, providing business intelligence and predictive analytics to help reduce delays. Shippers may acquire a quick insight of shifting transit times, which is critical for determining dynamic lead times for order cycle management in the near future. Real-time logistics visibility is provided through control tower and mobile app technology, allowing for proactive decision making. When shipments arrive at distribution centers, leading retailers utilize these technologies to schedule the correct amount and timing of receiving labor to unload freight. They can have better control over labor planning and expenditures with proactive visibility.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Collaborations between shippers and carriers should be expanded:</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Collaborative shipping gives merchants access to more carriers and types of delivery while driver shortages put even greater strain on their supply chains. Shippers can benefit from fleet assets rising two to three times in 24 months by using techniques like multi-shipper collaborative fleets. Even in a congested freight market, MTS partners with extensive shipper-carrier networks and collaboration systems can find the capacity shippers require. Those who use freight cooperation technology, for example, can rapidly uncover millions of possible pairings for creating continuous moving opportunities among their clients in order to increase capacity and efficiency. Furthermore, supply chain networks can be improved by smart designs that bring goods closer to customers while also enhancing service and cost control.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Retailers that are able to adapt to changing customer ecommerce behavior and focus on winning the last mile and achieving delivery expectations will stay competitive and flourish A ship-from-store fulfilment technique is gaining popularity. Ship-from-store allows merchants to meet demand across several channels, such as drive-up, in-store sales, and online purchases, all from a single location. Same-day services, including as order pickup, drive-up, and Ship, climbed 212 percent year over year for the full year 2020, according to Target's earnings announcement.</p>
                <p>Full-featured parcel transportation management systems (PTMS) are enterprise-class, multi-carrier solutions that help maintain stability while minimizing parcel shipping disruptions to help implement these objectives. This technology is being used by world-renowned merchants to streamline and optimize carrier and service method selection. A PTMS can also handle complicated setups for carrier agility, temperature sensitivity, cold chain variables, regulatory compliance, and supply chain compliance while supporting label printing, real-time tracking, and business intelligence reporting at scale.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Enhance the Customer Experience:</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Retailers must also manage customer experience and expectations by developing seamless shopping experiences for customers who shop in-store, online, or on their mobile devices. Every expectation must be distinct and controlled at a large scale. The expectation is matched at every point by the retailer by offering real-time delivery dates, alternatives for in-store pickup, and local delivery. MTS partners help achieve this by breaking down silos between the ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, order management system, and PTMS, and integrating the systems to deliver information for a better, more consistent customer experience.</p>
