                </div>
                <p>Freight is defined as any shipment weighing more than 150 pounds. The movement of goods, commodities, and cargo in bulk by ship, airplane, truck, or intermodal through train and road is known as freight shipping. It can be transported by land, air, or water both domestically and internationally.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Freight Forwarding</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-5">A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent, sometimes known as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), organizes shipments for people or organizations to move items from a manufacturer or producer to a market, client, or final point of distribution. To move the cargo, forwarders contract with a carrier or numerous carriers. The forwarder does not actually move the items; instead, he or she serves as a logistical expert. Ships, airplanes, trucks, and trains are among the means of transportation used by the carriers, and many modes are frequently used for a single item. The freight forwarder may, for example, arrange for cargo to be trucked from a plant to an airport, flown to the destination city, and then trucked from the airport to a customer's building. Overseas freight forwarders often handle international shipments and have added expertise in customs documentation preparation and processing, as well as other international shipping-related services</p>

                </div>
                <p>There are 18 freight classes in the National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC), with Class 50 being the lowest and Class 500 being the highest. The higher the class, the more you'll pay per hundred pounds shipped. Shiptree assigns a freight class to each shipment based on four factors:</p>

                <p> <strong class="font-weight-bold">Density:</strong> Is it a pallet of stone or a pallet of ping pong balls that you're transporting?</p>

                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Stowability:</strong> What are the dimensions of the shipment? How much space does the shipment take up? Is it angled in an unusual way, taking up more room than usual?
                </p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Handling:</strong> Is the cargo palletized for transport?</p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Liability:</strong> Are you transporting high-value electronics or crates of worn clothing?</p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Terms of sale for freight:</strong>
                    The majority of goods purchases require an agreement on freight terms, which are frequently mentioned in the quote, contract, or general terms and conditions. They aid in determining who is responsible for costs and risk (the seller or the buyer) at various points along the shipment's path. INCOTERMS rules are widely used to refer to freight terms for international shipments (International Commercial Terms).</p>
