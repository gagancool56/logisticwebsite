                <p> Companies that optimize their supply chains maximize earnings through their supply chain activities. To maximize profit, you must strike a balance between cost and client service. A high-cost / high-service, or low-cost / low-service supply chain design is efficient (also known as Pareto Optimal). A high-cost/low-service model, on the other hand, is inefficient and uncompetitive. To optimize your supply chain, you must do a thorough Supply Chain Analysis that includes all of your cost-drivers and customer service metrics. To optimize your supply chain, you must do a thorough Supply Chain Analysis that includes all of your cost-drivers and customer service metrics.</p>

                <p>The cost of transportation is mostly determined by the distance travelled. By locating their manufacturing or warehouses close to their consumers, a corporation can reduce transportation expenses. This offers the added benefit of lowering client delivery times, which is an important component of customer service. (However, as will be explained further below, this also raises facility costs.) Companies must carefully choose their facility locations, mode of transportation (boat, barge, rail, full truck, less-than-truckload, delivery vans, and drones), and optimize their routes because transportation costs account for the largest percentage of supply chain expenditures.</p>

                <p>Inventory costs are the most evident cost versus customer service tradeoff. More inventory (almost) always means better customer service, however inventory costs money and has other drawbacks such as obsolescence and storage expenses. As a result, inventory is a two-edged sword. It's a weapon against competitors in terms of providing superior customer service, as well as a risk to cash flow. Inventory is the second most expensive aspect of the supply chain. To maximize the financial return on inventory investment, inventory optimization tools and methodologies are available.</p>
