                </div>
                <p>A warehouse stores products, whereas a distribution center, in addition to storing them, provides value-added services such as product mixing, order fulfillment, cross docking, and packaging. When opposed to a warehouse, a distribution center holds things for a shorter period of time.</p>
                <p>Distribution management is the process of overseeing the movement of commodities from a supplier or producer to a point of sale. Packaging, inventory, warehousing, supply chain, and logistics are all examples of activities and operations that fall under this umbrella phrase. Workers in the warehousing and distribution center operations pathway work at transportation and distribution facilities like ports, terminals, warehouses, and other locations.</p>
                <p>You must meet the challenge of a more complicated supply chain, since customer expectations are continuously changing. Who says you can't manage growth, improve customer experience, and stay up with new technologies while lowering costs and simplifying operations? That is not the case with us. "Bring it on," we say‚Äù.</p>
