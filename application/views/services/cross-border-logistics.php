                </div>
                <p>There are 18 freight classes in the National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC), with Class 50 being the lowest and Class 500 being the highest. The higher the class, the more you'll pay per hundred pounds shipped. Shiptree assigns a freight class to each shipment based on four factors:</p>

                <p> <strong class="font-weight-bold">Density:</strong> Is it a pallet of stone or a pallet of ping pong balls that you're transporting?</p>

                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Stowability:</strong> What are the dimensions of the shipment? How much space does the shipment take up? Is it angled in an unusual way, taking up more room than usual?
                </p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Handling:</strong> Is the cargo palletized for transport?</p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Liability:</strong> Are you transporting high-value electronics or crates of worn clothing?</p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold"> Terms of sale for freight:</strong>
                    The majority of goods purchases require an agreement on freight terms, which are frequently mentioned in the quote, contract, or general terms and conditions. They aid in determining who is responsible for costs and risk (the seller or the buyer) at various points along the shipment's path. INCOTERMS rules are widely used to refer to freight terms for international shipments (International Commercial Terms).</p>
