                <ul>
                    <li>Cost-effective - you just pay for the trailer you use. </li>
                    <li>Because your goods is broken into smaller sections, it is more secure in shipment. </li>
                    <li>Shipping Liftgates, indoor pickup and delivery, and other customized services are frequently available through LTL.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated dispatchers available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and round-the-clock customer service.</li>
                    <li>Expedited shipping ensure on-time delivery. </li>
                    <li>To transport hazardous materials, you must be fully certified. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>More cost-effective for large shipments compared to several small shipments.</li>
                    <li>The needs of other shippers "sharing" the vehicle are not a factor. From origin to destination, a shipment never leaves its vehicle, ensuring the safety of shipments.</li>
                    <li>FTL is faster and it has the potential to be more efficient as well.</li>
                    <li>For sensitive commodities, FTLis frequently preferable because your freight will not need to be emptied and reloaded many times during travel.</li>
                    <li>Distance, the lane the freight is going on, and the season all affect truckload costs, but weight isn't a consideration because you pay for the entire trailer so for large shipments, cost-effective pricing are available.</li>
