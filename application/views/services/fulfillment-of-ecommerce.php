                    <h2 class="text-primary">Benefits of eFulfillment</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Order fulfillment companies keep your goods (i.e., your products) and fill orders on your behalf (they could come from in-store shoppers or online customers). Fulfillment providers usually do this by integrating their software with your ecommerce site and streamlining the entire fulfillment process. They pick, pack, and prepare the merchandise for distribution after receiving an order.
                </p>
                <p>Shipment pickups are also coordinated and scheduled by fulfillment providers with carriers including FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The majority of fulfillment companies charge a set monthly storage fee. The quantity of bins/palettes you store in their facility determines the flat charge. They then impose additional fees after an order has been shipped.
                </p>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Reduce Your Shipping Fees:</strong> Many order fulfillment companies have locations across the county and abroad. This lays a solid foundation for lower shipping prices, allowing you to take advantage of bulk delivery reductions.
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Lower your operating expenses:</strong> You just pay for what you utilize with fulfillment services. For your products that are being warehoused, fulfillment providers normally charge a set storage cost. After that, you'll only be charged for orders that have been picked, packaged, and dispatched. While you may see a seasonal increase or drop in sales, this will have no impact on your base costs. Only when the quantity of units you store varies do your storage costs vary.
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Extend Your Horizons:</strong> With the correct order fulfillment supplier, you'll be ready to take your business to the next level, whether you receive an order from another state or from another country. Many fulfillment firms have the infrastructure in place to ship and deliver items to any location on the globe. You may expand your reach and expand into other markets by utilizing their global network.
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Make Customer Service Better:</strong> Customer service support that is dependable is an important component of running a business. Many order fulfillment companies give email or phone help 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Easy returns, exchanges, and reimbursements are all part of this. Retailers can use fulfillment services to satisfy changing customer expectations. According to recent study, nearly half of buyers (49%) think same-day delivery choices entice them to shop online from a certain retailer. Almost two-thirds of respondents (63 percent) desire delivery dates that are estimated or confirmed, and companies that offer same-day delivery have an advantage over 85 percent of their competitors.
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">Using Technology to Make Order Fulfillment More Efficient:</strong> Many fulfillment providers handle and dispatch your products using cutting-edge technologies. Their systems connect to your ecommerce site, resulting in a more efficient order fulfillment process that often includes the following services:-
                <ul>
                    <li>Inventory control is important.</li>
                    <li>Tracking of items</li>
                    <li>Security</li>
                    <li>Handling and shipping</li>
                    <li>Choosing a carrier</li>
                    <li>Processing of payments</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong class="font-weight-bold">You can concentrate on selling:</strong> Another benefit of outsourcing order fulfillment is the increased efficiencies it brings to your retail operation. While order fulfillment is easier doable for small firms, as your company grows, this duty becomes more complex. Order fulfillment might eat into your working hours when you get a growing number of orders from multiple sales channels (in-store, internet, sales events). You can, however, delegate the heavy labor to your order fulfillment center and focus on what you do best: developing your business. Concentrate your time and energy on product design, marketing, and sales.
